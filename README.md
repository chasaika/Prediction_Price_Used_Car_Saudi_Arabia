Machine Learning - Prediction Price (Regression)

Syarah.com is a website that offers services for buying and selling used cars in the Middle East, particularly in countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Syarah.com provides a platform for users to buy and sell used cars and offers automotive-related information such as car maintenance tips, vehicle reviews, and automotive industry news. The selling process on this platform involves sellers creating an account and documenting the cars they wish to sell on the website, after which the Syarah.com team inspects the offered cars.

Sellers are free to set their desired selling prices. However, if a seller sets a price higher than the generally accepted market value, it might make it challenging to sell the car as the advertisement or offer might become less competitive. Therefore, some users, especially new ones, may require information about the market value of the cars they are selling.

Based on this issue, in order for prospective buyers/sellers on the platform to perceive the offered prices as normal according to the market, for Syarah.com, a pricing prediction that offers fair estimates could increase the number of users/visitors as well as listings. In other words, the more users there are, both potential buyers and sellers, the potential revenue for the company increases. In this context, it's derived from a 'shared revenue' model between listings/sellers and the company.
